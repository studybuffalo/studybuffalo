	<h1>Design</h1>

	<p>
		While officially trained as a health care professional, I 
		have had the chance to work with numerous technologies to 
		deliver study guides and tools. The founding principle of 
		Study Buffalo was to develop and share tools to help other 
		students. After graduation, the focus expanded to include 
		practice tools for the health care professionals of Canada.
	</p>

	<h2>Licensing</h2>

	<p>
		Wherever possible, I try to provide my resources under an
		open source license. I typically do try to choose licenses 
		that require derivative resources to be licensed under an 
		equally permissive license, so please confirm that the 
		license is appropriate for your project. If you need an 
		alternative license, I am happy to discuss it on a 
		case-by-case basis.
	</p>

	<h2>Implementation & Consultations
	</h2>
	<p>
		While I am not formally trained, I have learned to use various 
		technologies to develop the Study Buffalo tools, including:

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Web Development:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Server Side Languages/Frameworks:</strong> Django, PHP
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, Visual Basic
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Database Languages:</strong> PostgreSQL, MySQL, 
				Microsoft Access
			</li>
		</ul>

		I am available to use my experience in health care technology to help 
		facilitate the development of other resources or the implementation of
		any of the Study Buffalo tools in a professional environment. 
		Systems using any of the above technologies are preferred, but not 
		required.
