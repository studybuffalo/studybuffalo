# Study Buffalo
## What You Will Find
Hello, we are the Study Buffalo! We are excited to see you taking an interest in our project.
This area is specifically the web hosting side of our projects. This will include all html, 
CSS, JS, and PHP files to run our website. Most of this is pretty boring stuff to be honest, 
but some of our practice tool stuff may be of interest to you. In progress versions will
be branched out for development and then merged back in when ready for release.

Finally, we are actually learning all this GitHub stuff from scratch, so apologies when we
inevitably screw something up!
