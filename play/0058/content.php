The Study Buffalo debate the merits of energy drinks.<br>
<br>
Pro: Keeps you awake to study and pass exams, diuresis effects can be used to treat lithium toxicity, B12 can be used to treat anemia, and at least it is not cocaine.<br>
<br>
Cons: Makes you go to the washroom, no B1 to treat Wernicke's, excessive use may reduce efficacy of lithium and precipitate a manic/depressive episode, and worsens anxiety and insomnia.<br>
<br>
Verdict: totally worth it.
