It is kind of obnoxious to post signs up saying "TAKEN" on seminar rooms. We are all doing exams. No one is going to kick the door in and start a sick dance party in your seminar room because you forgot to mark it. It is extra obnoxious to also use these signs to try and hold the shared space for yourself when you leave the room.<br>

Remember, we are all doing exams, so share the space and we'll all make it through this together!
