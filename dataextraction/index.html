		<h2>Data Extraction</h2>
		<p>Studybuffalo.com is a website designed to provide practice 
		tools and information to pharmacists in Alberta (and anywhere 
		else where they may be value). Some of our tools take 
		available resources and redesign them into user-friendly 
		interfaces that provide unique functionality and information. 
		To power these tools we often will extract data from 
		publically available databases, such as yours, to incorporate 
		into our systems.</p>
		
		<h2 class="MT1em">Web Crawlers</h2>
		<p>The aforementioned data extraction is powered by various 
		web crawlers designed with Python running on an Ubuntu
		server. To ensure minimal impact on your own severs we try 
		to ensure the following:
		<ul>
			<li>All web crawlers will identify themselves and link to 
				this page</li>
			<li>We will comply with your sites robots.txt file 
				(looking for it in your root directory 
				automatically)</li>
			<li>We try to limit our downloads and data extraction to 
				times and days where it is unlikely to be disruptive
				for your regular users. Additionally, we try to only 
				run the web crawler no more than once a week where 
				possible.</li>
			<li>We only make one copy of the required data. We use 
				this copy to parse and extract the required data and 
				then host it on our own servers. Our users will not 
				be using your bandwidth and other resources.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2 class="MT1em">Contact Us</h2>
		<p>While we hope that our above precautions are sufficient, 
		we understand if you have concerns with our web crawlers and 
		data use. We will oblige any requests to cease operations, 
		but do hope that you will contact us to discuss the issue 
		prior. These tools are currently being used to help deliver 
		patient care by numerous pharmacists and we hope that 
		alternative arrangements can be agreed upon to meet the needs 
		of all parties involved.</p>
